Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-multilingual-cased were not used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification: ['cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at bert-base-multilingual-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

The following columns in the training set don't have a corresponding argument in `BertForSequenceClassification.forward` and have been ignored: id, text, __index_level_0__, label_class. If id, text, __index_level_0__, label_class are not expected by `BertForSequenceClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.

The following columns in the evaluation set don't have a corresponding argument in `BertForSequenceClassification.forward` and have been ignored: id, text, __index_level_0__, label_class. If id, text, __index_level_0__, label_class are not expected by `BertForSequenceClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.
