# ausklasser
Code for the paper 'Ausklasser - a classifier for German apprenticeship advertisements' and the model published [here](https://huggingface.co/KKrueger/ausklasser). This code features the experiment pipeline. 

 # Running
 **Important** pipeline will **NOT** run, if you clone this repository, because data is not public. In the load_data.py script, the actual code has been replaced with pseudo code. This repository is meant for transparency and reproducability. 

The code uses the [GuildAI](https://guild.ai/) framework for experiment run automization and tracking. Having the requirements installed (including GuildAI) and activated (Virtual Environment), running the pipeline would require to navigate to the folder this repository is stored in locally via the shell and then run 
```console
./ausklasser:~$ guild run pipeline
```
